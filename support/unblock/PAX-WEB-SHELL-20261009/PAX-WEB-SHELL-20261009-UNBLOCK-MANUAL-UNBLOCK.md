# Unblock PAX-WEB-SHELL-20261009

## Diagnosis
The parent task `PAX-WEB-SHELL-20261009` was blocked because it required shared-file scope coordination for `packages/ui-tokens/src/realms.ts` and `packages/ui-tokens/src/colors.ts`. The passenger app UI (`p5-ui.tsx`) uses specific brand colors (`#0B5CAB`) and surfaces that need to be authorized and present in the `@drts/ui-tokens` package. However, modifying these files was outside the `write_scopes` of the parent task, leading to a rejection in the review phase (R8 in the 2nd and 3rd reviews, and R5 in the 4th review).

## Task-Scoped Changes
To clear the blocker, the following canonical changes were made within this unblock task:
- **`packages/ui-tokens/src/realms.ts`**: Added `passenger` to `RealmName`, `REALM_NAMES`, `REALM_DISPLAY_STRINGS`, and defined its colors in `REALM_COLORS` using the authorized brand colors from the P5 canvas.
- **`packages/ui-tokens/src/colors.ts`**: Added `CORE_SURFACES` and `CORE_FOREGROUNDS` exports to authorize the base surface colors required by the passenger app.

These changes provide the passenger app with the necessary authorized UI tokens without requiring the parent task to violate its `write_scopes`.

## Unblocked Next Step
The parent task `PAX-WEB-SHELL-20261009` should now resume and:
1. Rebase onto `dev` (or the merged state of this unblock PR) to receive the `ui-tokens` updates.
2. Update `components/p5-ui.tsx` to use the authorized `passenger` realm tokens from `@drts/ui-tokens` instead of hardcoded raw hex palettes, resolving finding R5.
3. Continue fixing the remaining reviewer findings (R2, R3, R4, R6, R7).
