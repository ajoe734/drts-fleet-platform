/**
 * Explicitly isolates fixture-mode persistence from a trusted, durable
 * runtime port (Codex reopen round 2/3, R4): `VoiceCallTurnCoordinator`
 * previously supplied a bare, always-successful no-op closure with no type
 * distinguishing it from a real CAS-backed persist, so missing/rejected/
 * stale persistence could never be represented at all, let alone fail
 * closed before the dependent state-commit/tool-execution/playback
 * `VoiceDialogueEngine.turn` otherwise gates on it.
 *
 * `mode: "fixture"` ports must never claim durability: `persist` may
 * succeed (so this worker's own in-memory conversation can proceed in the
 * absence of a reachable session store), but nothing it does outlives
 * this process, and `VoiceCallTurnCoordinator` refuses to run one for a
 * `production: true` engine (see `createFixtureDialoguePersistPort`'s own
 * doc and `VoiceCallTurnCoordinator`'s constructor) -- a caller cannot
 * accidentally end up fabricating authority this way.
 *
 * `mode: "trusted"` is the seam a real port implements once one exists:
 * `apps/api`'s DB-backed `VoiceSessionService` (`resolveInput`,
 * `recordControlEvent`) already provides the authoritative revision/
 * input/lease CAS `VoiceDialogueTurnPorts.persist`'s own contract
 * requires -- what is missing is only the issuance/route/HTTP-client
 * triple this worker needs to reach it (see `VoiceCallTurnCoordinator`'s
 * class doc), not a port shape to persist through once that exists. A
 * `mode: "trusted"` port's `persist` must reject (never silently
 * no-op/succeed) on an absent, rejected, or stale CAS so
 * `VoiceDialogueEngine.turn`'s existing fail-closed gating actually has
 * something to gate on.
