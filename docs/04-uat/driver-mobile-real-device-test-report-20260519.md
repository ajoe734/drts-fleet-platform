# Driver Mobile Real-Device Test Report — 2026-05-19

**Task:** `DRV-DEVICE-001`  
**Owner:** `Codex2`  
**Reviewer:** `Codex`  
**Date:** `2026-05-19`  
**Depends on:** `TST-E2E-006-DRV-MP`  
**Artifact status:** `provisional`  
**Overall read:** `human-in-the-loop evidence still required`

## 1. Executive Summary

This report records the current evidence state for Android and iPhone real-device
verification of the Phase 1 driver app covering login, device binding, platform
presence, task notify, accept, route intent, proof, earnings, and weak-network
recovery.

As of `2026-05-19`, this repo session did **not** have fresh Android or iPhone
install logs, screenshots, screen recordings, or operator notes proving those
flows were executed on physical devices. The repo **does** contain strong
repo-local and static evidence that the underlying flows are implemented and
covered by unit/E2E/runbook artifacts, but mobile install/distribution remains
externally gated by `EXT-003`, especially `EXT-003-BLK-007` (install evidence).

The correct interpretation is therefore:

- `login / binding / presence / accept / route intent / proof / earnings / weak network`
  all have meaningful repo-backed evidence.
- `Android real-device pass` and `iPhone real-device pass` cannot yet be claimed.
- `task notify` should be split into in-app notification state versus native push.
  The current repo shows in-app counters/preferences, but does not show
  `expo-notifications` or a mobile push-token integration. Native push delivery
  should remain `NOT VERIFIED`.

The unblock closeout at
`support/unblock/WF-DRV-MP-001-DEVICE-EVIDENCE/WF-DRV-MP-001-DEVICE-EVIDENCE-UNBLOCK-MANUAL-UNBLOCK.md`
confirmed that the remaining hold is external sourcing and scheduling, not a
missing repo-side implementation. The parent task should only be resumed for
live execution after Android + iPhone hardware, a weak-network test
environment, a credentialed human-in-loop operator, and `EXT-003-BLK-001`
through `EXT-003-BLK-007` are all available.

## 1.1 Current Hold Posture

| Field                               | Current value                    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Android handset secured             | `not scheduled`                  |
| iPhone handset secured              | `not scheduled`                  |
| Weak-network test environment       | `not scheduled`                  |
| Credentialed human-in-loop operator | `not scheduled`                  |
| Expo / Apple / Android distribution | `external-gated` via `EXT-003`   |
| Native-push scope decision          | `not decided`                    |

Until those rows move out of `not scheduled` / `external-gated`, this report
must remain `provisional` and the task must not claim a real-device PASS.

## 1.2 Resume Gate

When the missing hardware, credentials, and operator are available, resume this
task in this order:

1. Resolve `EXT-003-BLK-001` through `EXT-003-BLK-007` and attach the install
   artifacts, tester-group evidence, and release-channel owner proof under
   `support/sidecars/EXT-003/`.
2. Decide whether `RD-08` is satisfied by in-app refresh / badge only or
   whether native push delivery is a release requirement.
3. Execute `RD-01` through `RD-13` on both Android and iPhone with device-side
   capture and operator notes.
4. Promote this report from `provisional` to a real-device pass artifact and
   update the workflow matrix evidence cell to replace the HOLD note with a
   PASS citation.

## 3. Scenario Matrix

Status legend used here:

- `PASS`: real-device evidence attached in this report
- `FAIL`: real-device execution happened and failed
- `BLOCKED`: environment or credentials prevent execution
- `NOT RUN`: no credible evidence that the scenario was executed on that device family
- `STATIC EVIDENCE`: repo/unit/E2E/runbook evidence exists, but not a live device pass

## 4. Specific Findings

### 4.1 Login / device binding

- The current driver app posture is app-auth-first with direct API access, not
  Cloud IAP.
- Device registration, persisted session refresh, revoke, suspend-aware
  invalidation, and rebind semantics are already documented and tested.
- No fresh physical-device capture is attached in this task for either Android
  or iPhone.

### 4.2 Platform presence

- Repo evidence supports:
  - per-platform online/offline toggle
  - token expiry countdown
  - re-auth entrypoint
  - eligibility display
  - shared zh-TW platform status card
- This remains `STATIC EVIDENCE` until a real device shows the full loop with
  state transition and post-refresh UI.

### 4.3 Task notify

- The UAT scenario pack expects a `task_assigned` notification before accept.
- The current driver app clearly exposes notification counts and notification
  preference toggles.
- This worktree does **not** show `expo-notifications`, push-token registration,
  or native push permission handling in `apps/driver-app/package.json` or the
  current app sources.
- Therefore the honest read is:
  - in-app reminder / badge posture exists
  - native push delivery is not proven and should not be claimed in this report

### 4.4 Route intent / forwarded tasks

- Route-locked and `sourcePlatform` behavior is already part of
  `TST-E2E-006-DRV-MP` and the E2E-002 matrix.
- That flow is still externally gated when the environment lacks seeded
  forwarded tasks or live adapter data.

### 4.5 Proof and weak network

- Completion proof guardrails are already wired for:
  - `MIN_PHOTO_COUNT_NOT_MET`
  - `PROOF_REQUIRED`
  - `EXPENSE_PROOF_REQUIRED`
- Pending completion replay exists specifically to survive transient failure and
  reuse the same request id.
- The runbook also requires revoked/expired identity to interrupt replay and
  route the driver back to onboarding.
- All of that is strong repo evidence, but there is no fresh Android/iPhone
  network-conditioning capture in this task.

## 5. Repo-Local Verification Run

The following commands were executed in this repo session to support this
report. These are **not** substitutes for physical-device UAT, but they confirm
the local implementation and scripted evidence remain coherent.

## 6. Blocking Items

The main blockers preventing a `PASS` read for Android and iPhone real-device
verification are:

1. `EXT-003-BLK-001` through `EXT-003-BLK-007` are not all resolved, and the
   install evidence gate remains open.
2. Expo / Apple / Android signing and tester-group evidence are not attached in
   this repo session.
3. Physical Android + iPhone hardware, a weak-network test environment, and a
   credentialed human-in-loop operator are not yet scheduled.
4. Forwarded-task real-device validation still depends on seeded or live
   adapter data.
5. Native push-notification proof is absent; current repo evidence only supports
   in-app notification state.
6. No fresh human-executed screenshots, recordings, or operator notes are filed
   under `docs/04-uat/` or `support/sidecars/` for this task.
7. Repo-local `pnpm` verification that depends on `tsc` / `vitest` is blocked in
   this isolated worktree because `node_modules` are not present.

## 7. Required Human Follow-Up To Convert This Report To PASS

To upgrade this report from `provisional` to a true real-device pass, attach:

1. Android install artifact + install log + first-launch screenshot.
2. iPhone install artifact/TestFlight-or-dev-client proof + first-launch
   screenshot.
3. Evidence that `EXT-003-BLK-001` through `EXT-003-BLK-007` are resolved for
   the actual build under test.
4. Confirmation that one Android handset, one iPhone, a weak-network setup, and
   a credentialed operator were scheduled for the run.
5. Registration/binding evidence on both device families.
6. Platform presence toggle and re-auth capture on at least one bound platform.
7. One owned task accept flow and one forwarded-task route-locked flow.
8. One completion negative-path proof sample and one successful completion
   replay-under-weak-network sample with request-id continuity.
9. One earnings-by-platform capture after task completion.
10. An explicit note whether `task notify` is satisfied by in-app refresh/badge
   only or whether native push is a release requirement.
