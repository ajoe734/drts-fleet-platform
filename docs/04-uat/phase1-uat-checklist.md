# Phase 1 UAT Execution Checklist

**Status:** Baseline execution checklist — final evidence interpretation now lives in `support/sidecars/FBP-013C/FBP-013C-UAT-EVIDENCE-PACK.md` and `support/sidecars/FBP-013D/FBP-013D-FINAL-EVIDENCE-CLOSEOUT.md`
**Owner:** Claude (WE-005 baseline)
**Task:** WE-005 baseline; consumed by `FBP-013C` and `FBP-013D` for final closeout
**Created:** 2026-04-14  
**Scenario source:** `docs/04-uat/phase1-uat-scenarios.md`

This file remains the canonical row-by-row checklist inventory. Use the `FBP-013C` evidence
pack for current deferred-item math, static verification coverage, and sign-off framing, and
use `FBP-013D` for the final release / pilot / production decision read.

## How to Use This Checklist

1. Work through each surface section with a test account that has the required role.
2. Mark each row: ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⏸ Deferred / 🔄 Retest
3. For any Fail, open a bug entry with: scenario ID, steps to reproduce, actual result,
   expected result, severity (`P1-Critical` / `P2-Major` / `P3-Minor`).
4. **All P1 items must pass before Phase 1 can ship.**
5. Deferred items require sign-off from the supervisor that the deferral is acceptable.
